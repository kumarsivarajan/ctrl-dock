ControlDock is multiple tools rolled into one. We consider this to be the jack of all IT Administration functions to get the job done.

What started out as an effort to move away from using OTRS as a ticketing system has moved on to become a solution suite which we felt could be used by Small & Medium Businesses and Managed Service Providers around the world.

The objective of the tool was to provide a consolidated single interface to encompass not just Ticketing, but the entire gamut of IT support activities such as Physical Asset Management, Hardware Inventory, Software Inventory, User Management & Provisioning, Network Monitoring to name a few.

We have achieved this by stitching together existing open source tools and customizing them with our own stack to provide a simple, yet powerful (Remote) Infrastructure Management application.
